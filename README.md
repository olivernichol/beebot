# BeeBot
A very ridiculous discord Bot built for Discord.JS 12.0, that spawns bees onto minecraft servers.

This project was made as a joke. Back in 2020, I was part of a quarantine Minecraft server community, as an admin - and I had a habit of irritating the moderators, by spawning excessive amounts of bees (which were new to Minecraft at the time) and crashing the server. As a result of this, when one of our moderators went on break for a week, they said to me "and don't spawn any bees while I'm gone." A week later, Beebot was fully operational.

Over time, the project developed and included various other features, including music playback (the copyright of such I cannot guarantee to be valid in any way), many, MANY injokes and other terrible code (I've had to sanitize this project before uploading it, just to make sure it's not TOO NSFW) - so with that in mind, do consider this a very old demonstration of my work in NodeJS, I'm happy to provide more recent demonstrations upon request.
